# Code for Tuscaloosa Strategic Plan 2015

## Who We Are
Code for Tuscaloosa is a group of citizens working to better their community using civic technology.

### Core Leadership Team
1. Captain: Matthew Leeds, mwl458@gmail.com
2. Community Organizer: Tarif Haque, thaque@crimson.ua.edu

### Municipal Partner
Chuck Crocker <ccrocker@tuscaloosa.com> City of Tuscaloosa, CIO

### Community Partners
* Pamela Williamson <pwilliamson@tuscaloosa-library.org> Tuscaloosa Public Library, Assistant Director of Public Services. Ms. Williamson is a great contact for understanding community needs.

* Joey Weed <jlweed@crimson.ua.edu> UA Design for America, Studio Lead. We plan to work with DFA on projects when they need technology help.


## What We Want to Do This Year

1. **Evaluate Community Needs**: We want to find out where we can have the most impact in the community and address those needs.

2. **Encourage Open Data**: If the city knows how many people want an open data policy, they will be more likely to implement one. We need to educate people about the importance of open data and directly petition for one.

3. **Progress existing projects**: We want to get our projects to a working state so they will be useful. Some of our activities:
* [Cute Pets Tuscaloosa](https://github.com/CodeforTuscaloosa/CutePets) *redoployed* (tweets adoptable pets in the area)
* [UA Budget Visualization](https://github.com/CodeforTuscaloosa/Visual-Town-Budget) *in progress* (helps people understand how the University of Alabama spends its funds)
* [Storm Safe Alabama](https://github.com/mleeds95/StormSafeAlabama-android) *in progress* (helps people locate nearby storm shelters)
* [Open Disclosure](https://github.com/CodeforBirmingham/Open-Disclosure) *in progress* (helps people understand state campaign finance data)
